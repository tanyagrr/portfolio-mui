              Motivated junior frontend developer with comprehensive training in
              JavaScript, React, and modern web development practices. Completed
              intensive coursework and built multiple projects demonstrating
              proficiency in DOM manipulation, API integration, state

              Prior to transitioning into frontend development, worked as a
              self-employed English tutor, interpreter, and museum guide. These
              roles strengthened communication skills, adaptability, attention
              to detail, and the ability to explain complex ideas clearly –
              skills that translate directly into writing maintainable code,
              collaborating with teams, and building user-friendly interfaces.

              Highly organized, self-disciplined, and comfortable working
              independently or as part of a team. Eager to grow as a frontend
              developer, learn from experienced engineers, and contribute
              thoughtfully to real-world products.
